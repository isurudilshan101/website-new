				"Sri Lanka Travel and Tourism were great from start to finish! Very quick response 
                    on the first vontact as well as planning our journey atendimh to our requirements. 
                    They met all our expectations from places to visit and hotels chosen, and they got us a driver for our 6 day 
                    stay that made it all possible. I highly recommend Sri Lanka Travel and Tourism, as our experience with them was excellent."
